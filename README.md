# Anvil provider benchmarks

This repository benchmarks Anvil providers by running Ethereum block simulations and invoking the systemShutdown method from Convex Finance, known for high gas consumption and multiple token transfers.

## Background

The Ipc and Ethers Reth middleware functionality has been developed by Sorella Labs for our back-testing needs. Our hope is to contribute these developments to Foundry in the near future.

## Benchmarks

The repository contains the following benchmarks:

1. **Convex Finance System Shutdown Simulation**: This benchmark simulates the system shutdown of the Convex Finance protocol.

2. **Block Simulation Benchmark**: This benchmark replicates the execution of high-gas Ethereum blocks as both a standalone block simulation & sequence block simulation.

## Methodology

Using the Criterion.rs library for Rust benchmarking, we follow these procedures:

1. **Convex Finance System Shutdown Simulation**: Each test begins by warming up the CPU and filling up the cache by repeatedly executing the benchmark function. Then, a system shutdown operation for the Convex Finance protocol is simulated using various Anvil provider configurations. Each operation is timed and the results are logged.

2. **Single Block Simulation**: This simulates a single Ethereum block repeatedly, with each instance requiring a state fork by Anvil. The block is executed and mined, and the time taken to execute the block is logged.

3. **Sequential Block Simulation**: This process extends to a sequence of Ethereum blocks. Anvil forks the state for the first block only and then executes transactions continuously across the sequence of blocks.

At each stage, logged times are statistically analyzed with Criterion.rs.

### Environment

Benchmark tests are conducted on an AWS is4gen.2xlarge instance. To ensure accurate performance measurements, storage caching is disabled.
The environment setup is as follows:

```
# cargo +nightly version -v

- As we can see here, ethers-reth is not only faster, but it is also more consistent.

### Setup

You will need Rust and Cargo installed to run these benchmarks. You can install Rust by following the instructions [here](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).

Next, clone the repository and navigate to the root directory:

```
git clone https://github.com/AnvilEthereum/anvil-benchmarks.git
cd anvil-benchmarks
```

Note: Running these benchmarks requires a local Reth archive node.

### Running Benchmarks

Once you have the necessary prerequisites installed and cloned the repository, you can run the benchmarks.

1. Copy the template for the environment variables configuration:

```
cp .env.example .env
```

In the resulting `.env` file, fill out the following fields:

- `ETH_RPC_URL`: This should be a URL to an Ethereum archive node.
- `ETH_RPC_URL_LOCAL`: This should be a URL to your local Ethereum node.
- `ETH_IPC_PATH`: IPC path to the local node.
- `ETH_DB_PATH`: Reth DB path to the local archive node.

2. Load the environment variables into your shell:

```
source .env
```

3. Run the benchmarks:

Prior to initiating the benchmarks, it's advised to reduce the sample size. With the current setting, each benchmark is executed 1000 times, which can significantly prolong the completion time.
To run all benchmarks & generate a report in the BENCHMARSK.md file:

```
cargo criterion --message-format=json | criterion-table > BENCHMARKS.md
```

### Reporting

Benchmark results are displayed in the console. For more detailed statistics, Criterion saves the data in target/criterion. Open the `index.html` file generated by Criterion in a web browser for more insights & graphs.
