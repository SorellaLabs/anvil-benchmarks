# Anvil provider benchmarks

This repository benchmarks Anvil providers by running Ethereum block simulations and invoking the systemShutdown method from Convex Finance, known for high gas consumption and multiple token transfers.

## Background

The Ipc and Ethers Reth middleware functionality has been developed by Sorella Labs for our back-testing needs. Our hope is to contribute these developments to foundry in the near future.

## Benchmarks

The repository contains the following benchmarks:

1. **Convex Finance System Shutdown Simulation**: This benchmark simulates the system shutdown of the Convex Finance protocol.

2. **Block Simulation Benchmark**: This benchmark replicates the execution of high gas Ethereum blocks as both a standalone block simulation & sequence block simulation.

## Methodology

Using the Criterion.rs library for Rust benchmarking, we follow these procedures:

1. **Convex Finance System Shutdown Simulation**: Each test begins by warming up the CPU and filling up the cache by repeatedly executing the benchmark function. Then, a system shutdown operation for the Convex Finance protocol is simulated using various Anvil provider configurations. Each operation is timed and the results are logged.

2. **Single Block Simulation**: This simulates a single Ethereum block repeatedly, with each instance requiring a state fork by Anvil. The block is executed and mined, and the time taken to execute the block is logged.

3. **Sequential Block Simulation**: This process extends to a sequence of Ethereum blocks. Anvil forks the state for the first block only and then executes transactions continuously across the sequence of blocks.

At each stage, logged times are statistically analyzed with Criterion.rs.

### Environment

Benchmark tests are conducted on an AWS is4gen.2xlarge instance. To ensure accurate performance measurements, storage caching is disabled.
The environment setup is as follows:

```
